# Strider

Strider is a simple app you can use to work on optimizing your running cadence to 180 steps per minute. This is mainly used for short strides, because on many Garmin watches the widget will automatically exit after some time. Simply navigate to the widget and then press the select button when you are ready to start a sprint/stride and it will start vibrating 180 times per minute for you to time your steps with.

This is my first Garmin app. It was primarily developed for the Forerunner 235. I originally made it for myself to use, but I decided to share it for free with anybody who wants it!
